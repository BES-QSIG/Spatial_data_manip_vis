 # Rgis_workshop
 
 #### For this workshop, the main material is found in RGIS_liverpool_workshop.md
 
 Together with the R script found in the RGIS_liverpool_workshop.md, you will need to download the data folder available [via this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jJMM_4zqrrkPvex-iJxPNAntTuKe6qt4/view?usp=sharing). The data are contained in a zip file (674Mb) that you will have to unzip and save in your working directory, or amend the path in the R script.
 
 **NOTE** This tutorial is a work-in-progress and I am expecting to maintain, edit and update the script to improve and add new material.
